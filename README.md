# Immo_Eliza_deployment


## 🏢 Description

The real estate company Immo Eliza asked you to create a machine learning model to predict prices of real estate properties in Belgium. 
This document describes the final stage of the project: model deployment.

This project follows previous stages in the [immo-eliza-scraping](https://github.com/NicolaasDC/immo-eliza-scraping), 
[immo-eliza-data-analysis](https://github.com/VB1395/immoeliza_data_analysis) and 
[immo-eliza-ML](https://github.com/NicolaasDC/Immo_Eliza_ML) repositories.



## 🚀 Objectives
```
- Deploy a machine learning model via an API endpoint.
- Host the API on Render. 
- Build a simple web application using Streamlit.
```

```

## 🤖 Usage

The Streamlit page is hosted here: https://immoelizadeployment.streamlit.app/.

The streamlit.py file creates the front-end app interface on Streamlit. 
The app accepts input for all features, then sends a request to the API's /predict endpoint to calculate the predicted price.
Once the button is clicked, the API responds with the predicted price, and a summary of the house and price is displayed.

The API is defined in main.py and hosted on Render using a Dockerfile. 
The link to the API is: https://immo-eliza-deployment-2ak3.onrender.com
